# PersonnalProjects
In this repository, you will find some personal projects that I did out of interest, for fun or for training.

Please email me on: ucemgir@ucl.ac.uk if you have any interest in them.

The Aortic Dissection Classifier is a code that uses 50 non-dissected and dissected images of the aorta. 40 of each are used for training andthe rest for testing.
The code will be further improved and compared using Convolutional Neural Networks.
The images were taken from anonymised patients.
