# PersonnalProjects
In this repository, you will find some personal projects that I did out of interest, for fun or training.

Please email me on: ucemgir@ucl.ac.uk if you have any interest in them.

---------------
Personal Projects:
The Aortic Dissection Classifier is a code that uses 50 non-dissected and dissected images of the aorta. Forty of each are used for training, and the rest are used for testing.
The code will be further improved and compared using Convolutional Neural Networks.
The images were taken from anonymised patients.
The random forest patched code is a comparison of the Aortic Dissection Classifier against the same code using patching of the image. (The run takes a long time)

Project Realised during Certifications:
Analysed Australian weather data, employing classification algorithms including Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM to predict rain occurrences. Pre-processed the data, trained models, and evaluated their performance.
